# JavaScript: A Name That Causes Confusion

JavaScript is arguably one of the most misunderstood programming language names out there.

People often ask:
_Is it related to Java?_
_Is it just a scripting version of Java?_
_Is it only meant for writing simple scripts, not full programs?_

The truth is, the name **“JavaScript”** came more from marketing than technical logic. When Brendan Eich first created the language, he called it **Mocha**. Internally at Netscape, it was known as **LiveScript**. But when it was time to release it publicly, **"JavaScript"** was chosen—mainly to ride the wave of Java’s popularity and to appeal to Java developers. The term _"script"_ was trendy at the time, especially for describing small bits of code running inside web pages.

So, JavaScript wasn’t meant to be a simplified form of Java—it was a strategic branding move. It could just as easily have been called **“WebJava”** or something else.

While JavaScript and Java share some surface-level similarities—like using `{}` to define code blocks and `;` to end statements—these come from their shared roots in **C syntax**, not from any direct connection between the two.

Interestingly, **Oracle** (through Sun Microsystems) owns the **“JavaScript”** trademark because of Netscape. However, the trademark isn’t really enforced today, and it’s unlikely that it could be.

Because of the confusion around the name, many people simply use **“JS”** as shorthand. It’s widely accepted and often used instead of the full name.

To make things clearer, the **official name** of the language—defined by the **TC39** committee and standardized by **ECMA**—is **ECMAScript**. Since 2016, each version is labeled by its release year. For example, the standard that modern JavaScript engines follow today is **ECMAScript 2019** (or **ES2019**).

> So, whether it's running in your browser or on Node.js, what we commonly call **JavaScript (or JS)** is actually an implementation of the **ES2019** standard.
